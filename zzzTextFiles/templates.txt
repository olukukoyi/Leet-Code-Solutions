DFS Template:

Global Variables / Result

DFS Function

    - Break Cases
    - Recursive Call
        - sometimes You might have to implement some logic before calling DFS. Like adding the node to a hash or stack to handle backtracking or for something else. It really depends on the problem
    - Logic when shooting back up tree / graph / callstack

Return global Result

------


BFS no queue or stack Template:

Globabl Variables / Result
    - make so to declare refrence to next level

BFS loop (while loop)
    -  BFS breakcase/logic
        - condition of while loop is ALSO a break case 
        - instead having break cases that return true or false, we have break cases that handles some sort of logic

Return global result



--------



When traversing graphs that may have multiple edges,
Create an adj list
Temporarily store to array of neighboring nodes in a temp array
As you visit the neighboring nodes, remove the nodes from adj array



--------


Dynamic Programming: 

Identify main problem
Break the main problem into sub problems
Choose how to contructn table (based off of sub problems)
