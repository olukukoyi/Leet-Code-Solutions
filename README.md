# Leet-Code-Solutions
The solutions to all the leet code problems I solved

These are in depth solutions to leet code problems. I completed majority of the Linked List, Trees and Graphing probles for blind 75

There are comments that break down the code and logic. I try to go into detail and break everything down so anyone can understand it.

I recently added a file called "templates.txt" This is where I will post most templates / patterns to problems. 

I also have a more in depth break down of every problem I solved.
